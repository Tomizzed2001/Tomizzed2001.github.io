                    This project aims to explore the uses of software engineering
                    principles, by developing a 2D game in Unity, to evaluate their
                    effectiveness in producing a working product within a set time frame.
                    The game aims to be fully functional during the time frame of this
                    project by meeting a set of minimum viable product (MVP)
                    requirements. By carrying out this project I hope to gain insight into the
                    professional struggles in software engineering / game development
                    and come up with solutions, so that I may pursue a future career in the
                    industry. The report states that the project will be a success if the MVP
                    is created, the player experience is positive and software development
                    practices are correctly maintained throughout.
